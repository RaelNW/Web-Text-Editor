## User Stories
AS A developer
I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection
SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

## Acceptance Criteria
-    GIVEN a text editor web application
-    WHEN I open my application in my editor
-    THEN I should see a client server folder structure
-    WHEN I run `npm run start` from the root directory
-    THEN I find that my application should start up the backend and serve the client
-    WHEN I run the text editor application from my terminal
-    THEN I find that my JavaScript files have been bundled using webpack
-    WHEN I run my webpack plugins
-    THEN I find that I have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file
-    WHEN I use next-gen JavaScript in my application
-    THEN I find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors
-    WHEN I open the text editor
-    THEN I find that IndexedDB has immediately created a database storage
-    WHEN I enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window
-    THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB
-    WHEN I reopen the text editor after closing it
-    THEN I find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB
-    WHEN I click on the Install button
-    THEN I download my web application as an icon on my desktop
-    WHEN I load my web application
-    THEN I should have a registered service worker using workbox
-    WHEN I register a service worker
-    THEN I should have my static assets pre cached upon loading along with subsequent pages and static assets
-    WHEN I deploy to Heroku
-    THEN I should have proper build scripts for a webpack application
